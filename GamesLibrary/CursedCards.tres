==How To Play==
In the main menu before starting, you can create a deck
When the game starts you will automatically draw some cards, each round after that you can draw 1 card for free the rest will cost AP
All cards have a Cost (AP cost to play), Health (amount of damage able to be taken before death), Attack (how much damage the card deals), and optionally an Ability (special card action) which details can be seen by hovering over it
The goal of the game is to lower your opponents health to 0, which is done by attacking empty spaces on their sides of the board
For the first round of each players turn their cards will not attack, after that your cards will automatically attack at the end of your turn"
